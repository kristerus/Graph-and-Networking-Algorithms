Bipartite matching can be weighted and unweighted. Bipartite matching consists of a graph, vertexes of which can be devided in two groups, i.e. job seekers and job listings.
It does not neccessarily gives back the max flow, and best result, unless it's run a max flow algorithm, such as [[Ford-Fulkerson algorithm]].
